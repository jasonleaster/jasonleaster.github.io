        <p>Looking back to this year, for leaving school and beginning to my career life, there have many changes, twists and turns in my life. There also have many moved and warm moments in this year. At the last day of this year, they all gone.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Last year, this time, I was busy in my school for finishing my graduation project “E-Face”. Particulary, I want to say thanks to my teacher Hongzhong Tang. Without her encouragement, I can’t do it well. It amost costs my half year time to finish this project.</p>
<p>Daily, I read paper about face detection. I pay a lot of time to code, debug and verify my new idea about the implementation.</p>
<p>It’s about in March and April. One day, my father call me and tell me that he felt not good. After the short call, I knew he need a surgery. Before the day when he has been performed the operation, I go back home to accompany him. He spent about six hours to finish his operation. During that time, I waited out sideof the door of the OR(operating room) all the time. After that, I stay at home for a month to accompany him and help him to recover.</p>
<p>June, thesis defense, take the diploma,  pack up and quit. I don’t feel happy for graduation nor sad for leaving. I just leave the place where I think it’s like a naive garden. From my perspective, school like a cage. They have a lot of things in common. Teenagers can’t adapt to industrial society, so adult set many rules for them and keep them in a place to avoid to be disturbed by the little guys.</p>
<p>Carrying heavy suitcases, it took me about 12-hours to come to the destination – ShenZhen, which everybody talk about.</p>
<p>Maybe, it’s for my shallow. I feel nothing different with my hometown but the high prices of daily necessities and the congested road. </p>
<p>It’s already half year ago but I can remeber that clearyly. I was impressed to remember that we lived in a narrow hotel room<br> and count how many moneys we have to spent everyday. We are anxious to rent a room but not to live in the hotel for more days. It’s too expensive for two graduate. Looking at the platfond, we sign with feeling how hard the life is. </p>
<p>I think I will remember the first night forever when we came to ShenZhen. We were hungry and go outside to the roadside with my girl friend to eat fried rice with eggs.</p>
<p>For one more month, I finished the induction process and she also found a job. We got start the “loop” of work, get off work, eat and sleep. There are lots of unstable factors in my life but it’s not that bad, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Thanks for my family and annabella. Without them, I can’t tell how can I get through this time.</p>
<p>This week, we get two tickets to get back home for Chinese New Year, which means that 2016 is ending. Finally, I wish my family and annabella’s family is health. Annabella will get a good job and stay with me as always.</p>
<p>2016 is ending, 2017 is coming. Wish you are becoming someone who you want to be. EOF.</p>

<p>Be wrong or right<br>Sometimes you’ve got to sacrifice the things you like<br>But I was born to try<br>No point in talking what you should have been<br>And regretting the things that went on<br>Life’s full of mistakes, destinies and fate<br>Remove the clouds look at the bigger picture<br>And all that you see is me<br>And all I truly believe<br>     – &lt;&lt; Born To Try &gt;&gt; Delta Goodrem</p>
